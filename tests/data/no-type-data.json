After playing [[college football]] for [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State University]], he was signed by the Falcons as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Schaller |url=http://www.collegian.com/2013/04/29/csu-footballs-thomas-caprioglio-and-kontodiakos-get-shots-at-nfl/ |title=Three graduating CSU football players get shots at NFL &#124; Rocky Mountain Collegian |publisher=Collegian.com |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n\"Momo\" was born in [[Kissimmee, Florida]], to Barry Thomas and Alousa Chappell. He has 11 siblings. His brothers are Greg, Javon, Richard, Tyuan and Santae. His sisters are Sophia, Shala, Theila, Kayla and Chardae. His family friend T'Sharvan Bell joined him at Osceola High. [[Bobby Sippio]], his cousin, played football as a wide receiver for [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky University]] in college, and now plays in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] . [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] has been a close family friend of his.\n\n==College career==\n\n===2008 season===\nOut of the 13 games that [[Colorado State Rams|Colorado State University]] played in 2008, Thomas got playing time in all of them as a Freshman, starting 10 times, with the inclusion of the New Mexico Bowl. He was 1/5 of the CSU true Freashmen that year. He finished the year off with 54 tackles, 38 of them being solo tackles. Three of these 54 tackles had also been for a loss. He broke up three passes and had an interception, which would have been a touchdown, if it weren't for a penalty that was called against them.\n\n===2009 season===\nHis playing time had been cut short two games from the previous year, only playing in 11 games. His starts had also dropped by two, starting in 8 games. Because of this, of course, his stats had dropped from the 2008 season as well, but not drastically. He still managed to earn 43 tackles, with one being for a loss of yards. He had made 31 of these tackles solo. He snatched an interception in addition.\n\n===2010 season===\nAs a Junior, he had to undergo surgery for his right shoulder. This forced Gerard to miss the majority of the season. He had only managed to get 13 tackles, 8 solo. Although he got another interception, too.\n\n===2011 season===\nBack after shoulder surgery in 2010, he played in 11 games, starting in every one. His interception stat had increased by one, catching two of them. He recorded 31 tackles, one for a loss, 15 solo. With one of those tackles, he had forced the ballcarrier to fumble. He forced one, and recovered a fumble, too. To top it all off, he had 7 pass breakups.\n\n===2012 season===\nIt was a disappointing season in 2012, as \"Momo\" started in the first three games for the Rams before hurting his shoulder and ending his season. However he got drafted by the Eagles, and participated in several Rookie Camps.\n\n===2013 Season===\nMomo is now a free agent, and is working out for the Alouettes in Montreal Canada.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thomas, Momo}}\n[[Category:1990 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football cornerbacks]]\n[[Category:Colorado State Rams football players]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Florida]]\n[[Category:People from Kissimmee, Florida]]","length":4470}

The couple have four children: B.J., Tarsis, Craig and Elenita.\n\n==Early life==\n\nUrusemal was born on the island of [[Woleai]] in the [[Yap|State of Yap]].  He attended secondary school on the island of [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] (then called Truk) at [[Xavier High School (Micronesia)|Xavier High School]], a [[Jesuit]] institution.  He would graduate from Xavier in 1976.\n\nUrusemal went on to attend and graduate from [[Rockhurst University]] (then called Rockhurst College) in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Missouri, United States. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Administration of Justice]] from Rockhurst, a Roman Catholic [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities|Jesuit university]].  Upon graduation, Urusemal accepted a position with the [[Jackson County, Missouri]], government, including the county Department of Corrections until he returned to Micronesia in 1982.\n\nFollowing his return to Micronesia, Urusemal became a teacher and guidance counselor for the [[Outer Islands High School]] on his native Yap.\n\n==Political career==\nUrusemal was elected to four-year term in the Fifth [[Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia]] in 1987.  He was elected as Yap's at-large representative.  Urusemal rose to leadership positions during his parliamentary career.  He served as  [[Floor Leader]] for twelve years during the Seventh until the Twelfth FSM congresses.\n\nDuring his political career representing Yap, Urusemal served on several congressional committees including Health, Education and Social Affairs and the Judiciary and Governmental Operations committees.\n\nThe president and vice president of the Federated States of Micronesia are elected directly by Congress and must be a duly elected member at the time of election. Due to the defeat of the then-incumbent president, Leo Falcam, in the previous elections, Falcam was unable to stand for re-election. On May 11, 2003, Congress elected Urusemal as President and he took office immediately.\n\nOn May 11, 2007, the 15th Congress convened. A  new [[Micronesian presidential election, 2007|presidential election]] was held and [[Manny Mori]] was elected president.

Beginning at the head of Gardner Canal, the park stretches inland along the [[Kitlope River]] to the border of [[Tweedsmuir Provincial Park]].\n\n==History==\nThe Kitlope River area is within the ancestral homeland of the [[Haisla people]].  The Haisla used the area for hunting and fishing, especially the production of [[oolichan]] grease, for which the tribe was famous along the Pacific coast. By the early 1990s, the [[West Fraser Timber]] logging company had acquired logging leases for large tracts of forest in the drainage.  The Haisla, along with Portland, Oregon-based advocacy group [[Ecotrust]], lobbied the company and the provincial government to place a moratorium on logging in the watershed.<ref name=Palmer>{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Tim|title=Pacific high : adventures in the coast ranges from Baja to Alaska|year=2002|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|isbn=9781559636506|page=335| url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Qzgw8SDQKCsC&pg=PA335}}</ref> \n\nIn 1994, West Fraser agreed to relinquish its lease without compensation.  In consultation with the [[Haisla Nation]], the provincial government established a Protected Area around the Kitlope on February 20, 1996.  In 2008, it was renamed a Conservancy, reflecting the co-management of the park by BC Parks and the Haisla. Conservancies in the park system are a lower level of protection than full Provincial Parks, allowing \"low-impact\" economic activities such as eco-tourism, but prohibiting heavy industries such as logging, mining, power generation and road construction.<ref name=Connelly>{{cite news|last=Connelly|first=Joel|title=B.C.'s 'Great Bear Rainforest' gets protection|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/B-C-s-Great-Bear-Rainforest-gets-protection-1302954.php|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=March 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe push for a park in the Kitlope valley was part of a larger effort to protect more of the coastal temperate rainforest in B.C., an ecological zone that has been heavily logged in the south of the province.  The Kitlope region is considered part of the [[Great Bear Rainforest]] (GBR), a term coined by environmental groups.  The Conservancy was the first major portion of the GBR to receive protection.<ref name=Connelly />\n\n==Geography==\nThe Conservancy covers {{convert|322,020|ha}} of [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|coastal temperate rainforest]], making it the largest such preserve in the world.<ref name=\"BC Parks\" />  It lies at the head of the Whidbey Reach of the [[Gardner Canal]], and encompasses the drainages of the Kitlope, Kalitan, Gamsby, Tsaytis, Kapella, and Tezwa rivers.  During the spring melt, these rivers are subject to heavy flooding and carry large amounts of debris.  Much of the park is mountainous; south of the Kitlope River the granite domes and ridges are part of the [[Kitlope Range]], a sub-range of the [[Kitimat Ranges]].  In the north, they form part of the [[Tochquonyalla Range]], a sub-range of the [[Tahtsa Ranges]].  Icefields and glaciers occupy the higher elevations.<ref name=Managementplan>{{cite web|title=Huchsduwachsdu Nuyem Jees/ Kitlope Heritage Conservancy Management Plan|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/cnsrvncy/kitlope/kitlope-mp.pdf|publisher=BC Parks|accessdate=18 May 2013|author=Haisla Nation/Province of British Columbia|pages=1-4|date=May 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe valley floors of the park are narrow, most being between one and two kilometres wide. Many, such as the Gamsby valley, are covered by braided channels of gravel deposited by the rivers.  The park has one major lake, Kitlope, which is fed by the Tezwa River and enters the Kitlope River near its [[estuary]].<ref name=Managementplan />  \n\nThe park is part of a large continuous area of protected wilderness.

Neil ([[Josh Gad]]), a doctor who is addicted to sex and masturbation, purposely grinds against a stranger in a train on the way to attend a sex addiction meeting. Mike ([[Tim Robbins]]) is a married recovering sex addict who leads the group. He sponsors Adam, who hasn't had sex in five years. Adam sponsors Neil. They are all at the sex addiction meeting, talking about their progress. Adam proclaims he's been 'sober' for five years, while Neil cracks jokes and admits he is only there because the court has forced him to. He goes back to masturbating the same night, and lies about being one month sober to the addiction group.\n\nAdam meets Phoebe ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) at a 'bug party' and they go out on a date. She reveals  that she is a [[breast cancer]] survivor and that her ex-boyfriend is an [[alcoholic]]; he does not tell her about his own addiction for fear that she will reject him. They begin a relationship. Dede ([[Alecia Moore]]) joins the sex addiction meetings, and reveals at her first meeting that she has been addicted to sex since she was a young girl. Neil, a doctor, is caught secretly filming under the skirt of his boss, and is fired. He then begins to take the meetings more seriously, and admits he has a problem. Meanwhile, Mike's son Danny ([[Patrick Fugit]]), a recovering drug addict, has returned home and is attempting to make amends to Mike and his mother Katie ([[Joely Richardson]]). \n\nPhoebe eventually finds out about Adam's sex addiction when finding an addiction token in his pocket the morning after sleeping with him. She takes some time away from him, but eventually agrees to continue their relationship. Neil talks Dede out of having sex with her abusive ex-boyfriend, and they go to a dance together. They come close to kissing, but don't. Mike and Danny get into a fight when Mike assumes Danny stole his mother's pills. Danny reveals that Mike gave Katie [[Hepatitis C]], and confronts him about hitting him when he was a child. Mike slaps Danny, who attacks Mike and knocks Katie over; upon realizing what he has done, Danny panics and runs out of the house.\n\nPhoebe has become frustrated with Adam's reticence to be physical with her, and breaks it off after they have a fight. Adam sleeps with a prostitute. Dede comes over to Neil's place, and helps him clean up his house and burns his porn. She admits she's never been 'just friends' with a man before. Mike finds Katie's pills, and realizes Danny didn't steal them after all. He and Katie get into a fight, and Mike goes to find Danny. While he is out, Katie calls him to tell him Danny is in the hospital after a [[DUI]]. Mike hugs his son in the hospital, who turns out to have been sober for the past eight months. Adam invites his ex-girlfriend Becky ([[Emily Meade]]) over, and as they start out by reenacting her father issues, she then wants Adam to slap her. When he refuses, she breaks down, locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide. Neil takes the train to get over to Adam's and breaks down his bathroom door to rescue Becky. Adam gets sober and goes back to Phoebe, who admits she too is not perfect. Neil confronts his inappropriately sexual mother, Roberta ([[Carol Kane]]), and all the addicts celebrate their sobriety.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Adam\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Mike\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Phoebe\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Neil\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Katie\n* [[Pink (singer) | Alecia \"Pink\" Moore]] as Dede\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as Danny\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Roberta\n* [[Michaela Watkins]] as Marney\n* [[Isiah Whitlock, Jr.]] as Charles\n* [[Emily Meade]] as Becky\n* [[Poorna Jagannathan]] as Lili Kazhani\n* [[Okieriete Onaodowan]] as Lou\n\n==Reception==\n''Thanks for Sharing'' was met with mixed reviews, with a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] approval rating of 50% (based on 109 reviews)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thanks_for_sharing/ |title=Thanks for Sharing (2013) |publisher= [[Flixster]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref> and a [[Metacritic]] score of 54 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/thanks-for-sharing |title=Thanks for Sharing |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\nRichard Roeper gave the movie a largely positive review, saying \"First-time director Blumberg does a fine job and makes some brave choices.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=RICHARD|first=ROEPER|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/22612401-421/thanks-for-sharing-makes-you-care-about-sex-addicts.html|title='Thanks for Sharing' Makes You Care About Sex Addicts|publisher=Chicago Sun Times}}</ref> Laremy Legel of Film.com was among the most critical, giving the film a D+, and commenting that it \"can't quite find its footing as either a drama or a comedy, and near the end it's actively sliding off the rails\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film.com/movies/thanks-for-sharing-review-2012 |title=Review: 'Thanks for Sharing' |last=Legel |first=Laremy |publisher=Film.com |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> Nigel Barrington of the ''Daily Chronicle'' also criticized the film heavily, dubbing it ''First World Problems: The Movie''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Otherwise, Alecia Moore's role was praised by critics.

{"title":"Portal Chess","body":"Portal Chess is a [[chess variant]] that uses at least two [[fairy piece]]s called '''Portals''' (or less commonly '''Portholes'''). These pieces can be easily added by using [[poker chips]], [[coins]] or other suitably sized objects. The game seeks to incorporate [[Portal (doorway)|portals]] to allow pieces to [[Teleportation|teleport]] around the board.\nApart from the Portals and their ruleset, the game often plays like ordinary [[rules of chess|chess]], including ''[[en passant]]'', [[castling]] and [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]].\n\n==Types==\nThere are three types of portal chess, created seemingly independently by three different people: David Howe in 1997,<ref>[http://www.chessvariants.org/boardrules.dir/portal.html David Howe at chessvariants.org]</ref> Mike Hidden some time before 2008,<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/portholechess/ Mike Hidden's site]</ref> and Ian Buckley around 2012.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4pJw_nk_0 Youtube video with rules]</ref>\nThey all, however, contain the core dynamic of teleportation and special squares/pieces for this, as opposed to other variants which allow transportation at any point and/or any time.\n\nThroughout the article, the symbol [[Arrow (symbol)|→]] will be used to denote teleportation from one square to another.\n\n==David Howe Version==\n{{alice chess diagram\n| tright|\n\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|  |bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|x1|  |  |  |  |  |  |x3\n|x2|  |  |  |  |  |  |x4\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n<!-- A -->\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|x1|  |  |  |  |  |  |x3\n|x2|  |  |  |  |  |  |x4\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|  |bl|nl|rl\n<!-- B -->\n| Two Board Variant with '''Portals''' marked as corresponding numbers\n}}\n\nIn this version, there are two distinct playing areas linked by '''fixed portals'''. These areas can be either two separate boards or one board split down the middle (between the d and e files).\n\nThe rules that are different for this variant are:\n\n*Players alternate play between area A and area B. So play might go 1:Ae4 Ba5 2:Bh4 Ae5\n*If a player's piece is on a portal square when the player is playing in that board, he can declare an ' ''intent to teleport'' '. He moves no other piece, and waits for his turn on the other board. He then teleports his piece but makes no other move. e.g. 20: 'Intends to teleport' qBe7 21: qAa4→Ba4 ...\n*Teleportation is always between areas, and also between corresponding squares. (as close to the original coordinates as you can get).\n*If an opponent's piece occupies the target square when teleporting, it is captured normally. (qAa4→xBa4)\n*If a friendly piece is on the receiving teleporter when 'Intent' is declared, the move is still lost but with no teleportation. This could be used as a pass function. e.g. 20: 'Intends to Teleport' qBe7 21: (no move,piece in way) Aa6 ...\n*If both players declare 'intent' in the same move, the teleportations are considered simultaneous. Thus no capture would occur between two pieces transporting together if they had just swapped places. e.g. 20:'intent' 'intent' 21: Aa4→Ba4 Ba4→Aa4\n*A king can be left in check so long as the player can move it before it could be captured. Thus [[discovered check]]s from teleportations are allowed as the player can move their king away before their opponent next plays that Area.\n*All other rules are the same.\n\n==Mark Hidden Version==\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xo|xo|  |  |xo|xo|  |  \n|  |  |xo|xo|  |  |xo|xo\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n| The locations of the portals are marked with black dots. \n}}\nThe portals in this game are '''neutral yet mobile'''.\n\nThe number and starting location of these portals can be different when the game begins, but the image shows the 'standard' set-up.\n\nIn this game the portal pieces move around by very specific rules.\n\n*A piece can only land on a portal square by 'attacking' it. This means pawns move diagonally onto them, and knights must land directly on them.\n*A piece can not jump over a portal, except for the knight.\n*When a piece moves onto a portal, it '''must''' move to another portal. If no portals are free to do this, moving onto the portal is not allowed.\n*When a piece has moved through a portal, the portal it 'attacked' moves to where the piece used to be. So the early move 2: f3xg4→c4  moves the portal from g4 to f3.\n*This also means portals may stack, and may be unstacked, but it is invalid to claim you have teleported from one stacked portal to another stacked portal (either where you have landed or elsewhere on the board).\n*Pawns must move normally onto the back rank to promote. So a pawn that has teleported there does '''not''' promote, as he is stuck in the portal.\n*Castling cannot occur if a portal is in the way, as the pieces cannot hop over it.\n*All other ordinary rules apply.\n\n==Ian Buckley Version==\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx|xx\n|xo|xo|xo|xo|xo|xo|xo|xo\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n| Beginning layout of the board is standard.

In the set up to the right, a5 and e4 can be conceptualized as the same square.\n\nThe specific rules for portal use are as follows:\n\n*The aim of portal chess is the same as ordinary chess.\n*Players place their portals anywhere on the fourth row from the players side before commencing a game.\n*You can only move your coloured portal.\n*A piece passes through portal unless the portal is blocked.\n*A piece can be blocked from entering a portal if a piece of the same color is on the other side.\n*A piece can take pieces by traveling through a portal.\n*Both portals cannot be occupied at the same time.\n*A piece can check/checkmate people using the portal.\n*A piece must exit the portal in the direction it traveled into the portal.\n*A portal can be moved onto a piece causing it to teleport, unless the other portal is occupied by any piece.\n*A player has a choice to move a chess piece or the portal piece in one turn, not both.\n*If your own chess piece is occupying a portal, you cannot pass through or rest on the other unoccupied portal with another one of your own pieces.\n*A piece can enter either portal regardless of colour.\n*Portals can not occupy the same square.\n*A portal can be moved regardless of whether it is occupied or not, the occupying piece does not move with the portal.\n*If a piece occupies one portal and a whole turn phase end without the piece moving from the teleporter it does not teleport.\n*A Knight can jump over a portal piece.\n*A pawn can become a queen by using a portal. thus the move ...→h8=Q is valid.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chessvariants.org/boardrules.dir/portal.html David Howe's ruleset]\n*[http://sites.google.com/site/portholechess/local-rules Mike Hidden's ruleset]\n*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4pJw_nk_0 Ian Buckley's first ruleset]\n**[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI2ITGUnaLg Ian Buckley's revised ruleset]\n\n[[Category:Chess variants]]","length":8087}

A good subject for a WP article on this material would be \"[[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)]]\", along the lines of some of the other DNA lineage articles that can be found linked off the [[Haplogroup]] article. The mitochondrial DNA group X is quite interesting for the early population history of the United States.  It has been suggested it may be linked to the [[Solutrean]] culture, excavated in SW France, which may have been associated with extensive maritime activity along the fringes of the Atlantic ice-age ice sheets, similar in technology to modern-day [[Inuit]] culture. In particular, it is suggested that the Solutreans may have brought the original stone-working technology underlying the ubiquitous later [[Clovis point]] to the Americas, which seems to have spread out from the ''east'' of the modern-day United States, in contrast to most of the paleoamerican population which is thought to have originated ultimately from Asia, and spread in from the ''west''.

{"title":"Robert of Milly","body":"'''Robert of Milly''' or '''Miliaco''' (died in 1238 or later) was the chamberlain of the [[County of Champagne]] from 1167 until his retirement in 1222. He was a [[Knight Templar]] and a patron of the order.\n\nIn 1190, Robert joined the [[Third Crusade]]. In preparation he donated  ten arpents of land and a family of serfs at [[Trilbardou]] to the Templars of [[Moisy]] and in exchange he was taken into the order as a ''confrater'' (lay brother), his mother was to be commemorated at Moisy and his sister Amelia and her husband, Manasses, were to receive spiritual benefits from the Templars.{{sfn|Schenk||p=215}} This donation was made on the condition that he die without heirs, yet by 1203 he had two daughters. He must have renewed the gift, for the Templars eventually built a house at Trilbardou.

He also leased the mills of [[Montceaux]] to the Templars, sparking a dispute with the monks of [[Montier-la-Celle]], which was not settled until 1216.

{"title":"Southernport Developments v Transnet","body":"In '''''Southernport Developments (Pty) Ltd (Previously Known as Tsogo Sun Ebhayi (Pty) Ltd) v Transnet Ltd''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], Transnet excepted to Southernport Developments' particulars of claim on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action. The particulars of claim required Transnet to enter into good-faith negotiations with Southernport regarding the terms and conditions of an agreement of lease in respect of the properties described. The basis of Southernport's claims was contained in a contract which provided for the option to lease properties on terms and conditions to be negotiated, and provided for the referral of disputes to an arbitrator. The particulars of claim further alleged that any dispute between the parties had in terms of the contract to be referred to an arbitrator.\n\nTransnet claimed that the relevant clauses were unenforceable,\n\n* because there had been no agreement regarding the essential terms of any lease;\n* because the terms of the agreement relating to the lease were void for vagueness; and\n* because the relief claimed was not certain and definite in its terms and therefore incompetent.\n\nThe thrust of the exception was that the essential terms of any agreement, in order to be enforceable between the parties thereto, had to be agreed to or at least capable of ascertainment. It was alleged that this had not occurred in the present case. It was argued further that an agreement which required further negotiations, as in the present matter, could not acquire contractual force; at best for the plaintiff, it was an agreement to agree, which was unenforceable.\n\nThe court held that, before an agreement of lease came into existence, there had to be an agreement between the parties upon the use and enjoyment of the property and the rental to be paid. Agreement upon the use and enjoyment of the property involved the identification of the property.\n\nFurthermore, the intended use of the property was not stipulated, so the parties had not agreed upon the use and enjoyment of the property, which was a requirement in any lease agreement. The agreement also contained no provision for the rental to be paid, another essential element of a contract of lease.\n\nThe provision for the appointment of an arbitrator provided a dispute-resolution mechanism, not one for fixing the rent or any other term of the lease.\n\nThe plaintiff's reliance on such contract therefore disclosed no cause of action. For a dispute to exist in the present context, there first had to be something more than a subjective intention on the part of the contracting parties which were not the same. There had to be some basis for an objective debate between them. There was no such basis in the present case; the appointment of an arbitrator could not assist the plaintiff in this regard.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[South African contract law]]\n* [[South African law of lease]]\n\n== References ==\n* ''Southernport Developments (Pty) Ltd (Previously Known as Tsogo Sun Ebhayi (Pty) Ltd) v Transnet Ltd'' 2003 (5) SA 665 (W).\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2003 in South African law]]\n[[Category:2003 in case law]]\n[[Category:South African contract case law]]\n[[Category:Gauteng Division cases]]","length":3345}
